## Description of Pricing Rule Logic

The pricing rule is applied based on the expiration proximity of the product. For example:

- If a product is nearing its expiration date (within the next 15 days), the price is adjusted by a set percentage (e.g., 10% off).
- This helps clear out near-expiry items by making them more attractive to customers.

### Example:

If a product has an original price of $100 and is set to expire in 10 days, applying a 10% discount would result in a new price of $90.
