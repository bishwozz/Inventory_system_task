# Inventory System Documentation

## Setup Instructions (Docker)

To get the project up and running with Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Build and run the Docker containers:**
   Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the app:**
   Once the containers are up, you can access the FastAPI app via [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

4. **Access the Swagger API docs:**
   FastAPI automatically generates API documentation using Swagger. Access it by going to:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

5. **Database setup (Optional for first run):**
   The Docker Compose setup will automatically create and migrate the database. However, if you want to manually create the database schema, you can use the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app python -c 'from app.db.base import Base, engine; Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)'
   ```

## Description of Pricing Rule Logic

The pricing rule is applied based on the expiration proximity of the product. For example:

- If a product is nearing its expiration date (within the next 15 days), the price is adjusted by a set percentage (e.g., 10% off).
- This helps clear out near-expiry items by making them more attractive to customers.

### Example:

If a product has an original price of $100 and is set to expire in 10 days, applying a 10% discount would result in a new price of $90.
